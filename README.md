# Color-Classifier-Prediction

This is going to be a simple website that has a toggle between differnt R,G,B colors. Our Tensorflow model hence will learn to distinguish colors overtime using crowd-sourced data and present the output.

## Built on
- Tensorflow JS
- DOM JS

## Features
- Color generation using RGB slider and storing to database.
- Database filtering and state redundant reduction
- Building Tensorflow model and training with the dataset 80/20
- Output as redish, greenish, purplish, bluish
